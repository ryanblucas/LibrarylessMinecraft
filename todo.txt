In order:
	-Necessary-
		Inventory
		Day-night cycle (with that, a lighting shader)
		Crafting
		
	-Optional-
		Don't generate all chunks at the same time, pop them in
		Separate graphics_debug from graphics
		Add color to debug primitives
		Further speed up meshing chunks and generating them
		Frustum culling
