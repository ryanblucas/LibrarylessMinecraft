In order:
	Fix liquid updating
	Make liquid shader
	Add graphics debug buffers, so instead of setting temporary primitives, you can store a
		buffer of primitives. This is useful for things like visualizing chunk borders
	Further speed up meshing chunks and generating them

	Frustum culling
	Health system
	User interface
	Inventory
	Day-night cycle (with that, a lighting shader)
	Crafting
